Hi there !

I am Xavier Camier, french Scrum Master and former developer working for a company located in France. I've built this blog to share with you some code, some good habits, some links and some technics. It's exploratory meaning it's not a coding lesson. However I hope you'll find it useful.

A lesson I've learnt from coding is that whatever we do, there is always an alternative/better solution. Feel free to propose, to comment, to challenge the content I provide. 

If you want to reach me, please use the links at the bottom of that blog. 

Enjoy !
