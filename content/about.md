Hi there !

I am [Xavier Camier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavier-camier-35b0445b/). This blog's objective is to share with you some code, some good habits, some links I found useful and some technics. What I'll do here will be mainly exploratory meaning it's not a coding lesson. However, I hope you'll find it useful.

A lesson I've learnt from coding is that whatever we do, there is always an alternative/better solution. Feel free to propose, to comment, to challenge the content I provide. 

If you want to reach me, please use the links you can find at various places of that blog.

Enjoy !
