Hugo is a static site generator built in go. It is free, easy to understand and highly configurable. In addition to the egine you can download templates to have quickly a look&amp;rsquo;n feel that suits your need. The posts are written in markdown which is very handy to perform quick formatting.
As all the content is text based, it is easy to manage versions, to collaborate and to transfer the site from one machine to another.</description></item></channel></rss>
